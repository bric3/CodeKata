# Palindrome detector

A palindrome is a sequence of symmetric characters. 
Examples:

* "abccba" -> even palindrome
* "abcba" -> odd palindrome
* "" -> not a palindrome
* "abc" -> not a palindrome

The exercice is to create a palindrome detector, such that for each input (sequence of characters) the detector replies by **true** or **false**
